## Description
The Third Eye is an initiative to help the police catch the suspect easily and efficiently. 
Say a police personnel wants to trace the route followed by a suspect's car, which would provide them with insightful knowledge on their current case. But, they would have to go through the labour intensive task of checking each surveillance camera nearby, having to watch hours of footage with  high chances of human error. All this time spent after such tedious work can be a crucial factor to determine whether the criminal gets caught or not. What if all of this could be done in mere seconds? The world would have way less criminals roaming around freely and this would take  surveillance record maintenance to a whole new level!

* Track a vehicle by license plate number - Use our search feature to track a suspected vehicle by using it's License plate number. Enter the number in the search bar and you will be able to view the path of the car on map
* Search by Video/Photo - This accounts for a more realistic scenario as this forms the basis of our idea. Continuous feed will be taken from the CCTV cameras, will be saved in the database, will be fed to our model and then the path of the criminal can be viewed easily on the map.
* Live tracking of the suspect - The suspect can be tracked live as well as his/her past events can also be monitored(as the images are being continuously uploaded on the database)

## Usage
 #### cd into client folder using the command
  > cd client
  
#### run npm start

## Applications

#### Our solution solves a big major issue that is being faced by the police
>Eradicates Manual Effort : Police have to check CCTV footage manually in order to track a suspect. But with this solution the manual effort of police has been simplified.

>This process can be done continuously over a period of time to even track the past activity of the suspect

## Future scope
#### Car Model And Colour
> Our model can be trained further to recognise the model of the car as well as the colour along with the license plate number so that it becomes easier and faster for the police to reach the suspect.
#### Recognition of fancy number plates
> OUr model can also be extended to recognise fancy number plates
