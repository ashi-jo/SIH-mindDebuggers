## Description
The Third Eye is an initiative to help the police catch the suspect easily and efficiently. 
Say a police personnel wants to trace the route followed by a suspect's car, which would provide them with insightful knowledge on their current case. But, they would have to go through the labour intensive task of checking each surveillance camera nearby, having to watch hours of footage with  high chances of human error. All this time spent after such tedious work can be a crucial factor to determine whether the criminal gets caught or not. What if all of this could be done in mere seconds? The world would have way less criminals roaming around freely and this would take  surveillance record maintenance to a whole new level!

* Track a vehicle by license plate number - Use our search feature to track a suspected vehicle by using it's License plate number. Enter the number in the search bar and you will be able to view the path of the car on map
* Search by Video/Photo - This accounts for a more realistic scenario as this forms the basis of our idea. Continuous feed will be taken from the CCTV cameras, will be saved in the database, will be fed to our model and then the path of the criminal can be viewed easily on the map.
* Live tracking of the suspect -
